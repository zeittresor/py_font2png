Using this script you can copy all your System Fonts to a folder called fonts in the same
directory where the script is working, after that choose a font from that folder.

If you click generate now a new folder will be created called "images" in that folder each
of the entered characters will be generated as png images to use them in other ways like
demoscene intros.

If you want to use the effects to be added by the generation process keep in mind that the
generation process might take some time because parallel calculations of fractal effect with
transparent alphachannel combined with other effects forces some processingpower (in that
case just wait, its telling you after the process is done.
